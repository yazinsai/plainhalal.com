title: "Why Invest?"

  Before diving into *how* we do halal investing, it's important to clarify *why* 
  you should in the first place.

There's alot of reasons for investing, and the primary one is obvious: you get more money back that you put in.

However, Islam teaches us the importance of maintaining pure intentions or *niyya*, and so let's dwell on that for a bit. 

You're not *just* investing your money to get more back &mdash;

Maybe you're doing it because:

- you want to help out your family
- you want the freedom to purse your own goals and aspirations, in the service of Islam, however that manifests
- you want to have more money to help your society, community or donate to beneficial causes

For me, it's all about **family** and that sweet, sweet **freedom**. I'd love to be able to pursue whatever projects I want to work on, without them necessarily having to turn a profit in this life.

Find out what the true reason is for you, and remind yourself of it often. This small action can turn a routine task into a source of good deeds that benefits you well after you're gone.
