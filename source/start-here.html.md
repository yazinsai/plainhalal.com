Investing is not the easiest topic to go about describing, and even as someone who's well versed with alot of the lingo, it can get overwhelming!

Part of this is due to the fact that there are **so many cryptic terms**. ETFs, Market orders, dollar cost averaging, dividends, mutual funds &hellip; the list goes on, and on.

Another reason investing can be confusing is because it lies at the intersection of so many fields &mdash; including finance, tax, and for us Muslims: shariah law.

## A Framework For Truly Understanding Investing

The key to understanding investing, as is the case with understanding any topic of sufficient complexity is to start with the trunk.

What do I mean by that?

When you want to learn a new topic, instead of starting with learning the minute details in order &mdash; instead try to connect the topic to topics you are already familiar with. This allows you to confidently build on knowledge that you already know, and fill in gaps in understanding so they form a cohesive whole.

Every new piece of information you encounter will lie on a branch that links all the way to the trunk. This is the technique that Elon Musk and many other successful "ultralearners" employ to enable them to not only retain but understand and process massive amounts of information consistently.
